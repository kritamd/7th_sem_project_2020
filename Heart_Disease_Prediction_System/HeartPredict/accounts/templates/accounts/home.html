      <p class="card-text">The heart is like any other muscle in the body.It needs an adequate blood supply to provide
      oxygen so that the muscle can contract and pump blood to rest of the body.
        Not only does the heart pump blood to the rest of the body, it also pumps blood to itself via the coronary arteries.</p>
      <p>The muscle that pumps blood received from veins into arteries throughout the body.
        It is positioned in chest behind the sternum . The normal heart is about the size of closed fist,
        and weighs about 10.5 ounces.</p><p> It is cone shaped,with the point of the cone pointing down to the left.
      Two-thirds of the heart lies in the left side of the chest with the balance in the right side.</p>
